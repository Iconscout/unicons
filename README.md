# Unicons

1000+ Pixel-perfect vector icons and Iconfont for your next project. These icons are designed by [Iconscout](https://iconscout.com).

## Getting Started

### Using as a font
It's easy to use Unicons on your website by just inserting following css. You can also download this repo and use the css from `css` folder.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unicons.iconscout.com/release/v2.1.5/css/unicons.css">
```

And use the icons in your `body` as below.
```html
<i class="uil uil-comments"></i>
```

### Using as npm package
You can easily install [Unicons](https://iconscout.com/unicons) using npm.
```bash
npm install --save @iconscout/unicons
```

### Using as an SVG
If you're a designer then it's always great to have SVG files. You can download SVGs from [Official Unicons Website](https://iconscout.com/unicons) or [download Icondrop](https://iconscout.com/icondrop) to access these icons right into Sketch, Adobe Xd, Adobe Illustrator, and many more.
